Assignment for semester 1 of OOP - Create a sci-fi inspired User Interface

Faye Donohoe - C15440182



My assignment is a user interface through the eyes of a space traveller. 
It includes a view of space and its many stars as the traveller floats through, graph to track daily star count for the last 7 days and
a fully functioning radar for enemy detection, but what are the chances of that happening? Right?


The stars are generated using an array list of star objects

Classes are used with inheritence to make the code more efficient.

The user must decide their own fate in the face of danger

In the face of danger however, the user must fight to survive.
